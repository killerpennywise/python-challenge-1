# python-challenge-1

## Scope -
The goal for this challenge is to create an interactable menu for the user
to order from a preconfigured dictionary of items. Containing the item names 
and prices. Mastering this exercise will allow the developer to showcase the skills
and information gained from the course during the lecture.

## Key Concepts -
To show mastery of what we have learned in class this week we must showcase what 
we learned in the following topics:
* Data Types:
    * integers
    * strings
    * floats
* Data Structures:
    * Lists
    * Dictionaries
* Concepts:
    * For Loops
    * While Loops
    * If-Else statements
    * Match-Case statements
    * Assigning Variables

## Steps -
* Step 1: Set up order list. Order list will store a list of dictionaries for
 menu item name, item price, and quantity ordered.
* Step 2: Ask customer to input menu item number.
* Step 3: Check if the customer typed a number.
* Step 4: Check if the menu selection is in the menu items.
* Step 5: Check the customer's input.
* Step 6: Loop through the items in the customer's input.
* Step 7: Store the dictionary items as variables.
* Step 8: Calculate the number of spaces for formatted printing.
* Step 9: Create space strings.
* Step 10: Print the item name, price, and quantity.
* Step 11: Calculate the cost of the order using list comprehension.
